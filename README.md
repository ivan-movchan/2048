</div>

My own [2048 game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)) implementation with a minimalistic interface and other interesting features.

## Installation

Download source code archive of [the latest release](https://github.com/ivan-movchan/2048/releases/latest) and extract anywhere.

The game should run well in any modern web browser with JavaScript enabled. The recommended minimal browser window height is `640` pixels.

## Game rules

Game rules are the same as in original 2048 game, except one detail: when sliding tiles with the same number, they **immediately** merge from the opposite side (`2, 2, 4` will merge to `8`). This interesting feature (bug?) accidentally appeared in the draft version of the project.
