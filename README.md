</div>

My own [2048 game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)) implementation with a minimalistic interface and other interesting features.

> [!WARNING]
> The project code is written by me from scratch and is not based on original game source code. Therefore, the game may not perform as excepted.

## Installation

Download source code archive of [the latest release](https://github.com/ivan-movchan/2048/releases/latest) and extract anywhere.

The game should run well in any modern web browser with JavaScript enabled. The recommended minimal browser window height is `640` pixels.
